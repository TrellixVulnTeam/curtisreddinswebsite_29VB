                        I am a Certified Salesforce Developer and 
                        Administrator with a background in computer 
                        programming and web development. I truly love 
                        learning new skills and applying them to create 
                        new and exciting applications. I built this React.js 
                        website to record my journey and use it as a portfolio for future projects. <br/>
                        <br/>
                        I was born in Dallas and raised in nearby Coppell, TX. 
                        After graduating high school, I moved to Austin, TX, to attend Texas.
                        I had always had a passion for history and felt that teaching was such a 
                        rewarding career. I was admitted to the UTeach program and graduated with 
                        a Bachelorâ€™s in History and a Certification to teach K-8 Social Studies.
                        I substitute taught for Pflugerville ISD, the same district I had student 
                        taught for, and really enjoyed my time there, but eventually decided to focus 
                        on my passion for music while I was still relatively young. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Serving tables allowed me to focus on writing and recording music, playing 
                        shows locally and eventually going on tour. I discovered my passion for programming 
                        and web development through this endeavor. I have always loved teaching myself new 
                        things and started to experiment with graphic design to create designs for shirts, 
                        record covers, logos, etc. This would eventually lead me to
                        dabbling in HTML and CSS.

                        <br/>
                        I decided to learn more and began taking courses at Austin Community College. I completed 
                        coursework in computer programming, graphic design, database programming, and web development. 
                        The more I learned, the more I fell in love with the material. I love the challenge of working 
                        on a complex project. I also love pushing myself and acquiring new skills. I am very excited to 
                        begin my career in the field.
